tblrelations
============

The goal of tblrelations is to fill in functions for working with tibbles in a RDBMS-like way (and on the way explore relational algebra terminology).

Installation
------------

You can install the development version of tblrelations from Github with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("jalsalam/tblrelations")
```

Example
-------

When working with data frames in R in a relational data way, it is useful to identify primary and foreign keys:

``` r
library(tblrelations)
library(dplyr)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'dplyr'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     filter, lag
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
library(nycflights13)

#> [1] TRUE

# pk_ish(flights, .keys = vars(year, month, day, carrier, flight)) # currently errors
```

See: [r4ds relational data](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html))

``` r

pk_ish(dplyr::band_members, by = "name")
#> [1] TRUE
# pk_ish(dplyr::band_members, by = vars(name)) # currently errors

fk_ish(band_members, band_instruments, by = "name")
#> [1] FALSE
# fk_ish(band_members, band_instruments2, by = c("name" = "artist")) # currently errors
```

Note: it should be possible to use rename\_at like options:

``` r
#rename_at(band_instruments2, vars(name = "artist")) #error b/c you must rename with a function
rename_at(band_instruments2, vars("name" = "artist", "instrument" = "plays"), funs(names))
#> # A tibble: 3 x 2
#>   name  instrument
#>   <chr> <chr>     
#> 1 John  guitar    
#> 2 Paul  bass      
#> 3 Keith guitar
rename_at(band_instruments2, vars(name = "artist", instrument = "plays"), funs(names))
#> # A tibble: 3 x 2
#>   name  instrument
#>   <chr> <chr>     
#> 1 John  guitar    
#> 2 Paul  bass      
#> 3 Keith guitar
rename_at(band_instruments2, c("name" = "artist", "instrument" = "plays"), funs(names))
#> # A tibble: 3 x 2
#>   name  instrument
#>   <chr> <chr>     
#> 1 John  guitar    
#> 2 Paul  bass      
#> 3 Keith guitar
```

Have you ever been surprised that a left\_join resulted in an unexpected cross-join or NA rows?

``` r
pk_ish(dfy, by = "id")
# TRUE if dfy$pk is unique
# FALSE if dfy$pk is not unique

fk_ish(dfx, dfy, by = "id")
# TRUE if all combination of "id" in dfx are in dfy and dfy$id is unique.

left_join_fk(dfx, dfy, by = "id")
# if there is a foreign-key-ish relationship of dfx -> dfy using "id", then it returns the joined table as normal, otherwise it errors.
```

Development goals
-----------------

1.  Make sure that the same semantics of the `by` argument can be used with `left_join_fk()` as can be used with the normal dplyr join verbs. Using rename\_at like semantics, it should eb possible to accept either a character vector or a `vars` specification.

2.  Add diagnostics and good error messages that let you know if there are missing or duplicate values on your dimension table. Maybe this should be under an option `verbose = TRUE` or something.

3.  Add an assertion version of some o fthese checks -- e.g., a good explanatory error message for use with testthat.

4.  Add right\_join\_fk. Are there other join relationships that make sense for these kinds of checks?

Much more speculative. Really need some DB research on what else might be helpful:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Maybe s3 object for which you can more permanently label pk?

-   Maybe express domains, codomains, onto, covers, or other such function/set theory types of concepts as tests on relations.

-   Maybe coerce a table to a function. E.g. :

``` r
join_dfy <- as_tbl_function(dfy, by = "id")

dfx %>% join_dfy(by = "id")
```

But there are plenty of questions about what else would be worthwhile.
